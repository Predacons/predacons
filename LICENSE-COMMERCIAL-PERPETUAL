(b)	Unforeseeable Damages. Neither side will be liable for breach-of-contract damages they could not have reasonably foreseen when entering into this agreement.
(c)	Liability Cap. Except for Section 12(d) (Uncapped Liabilities), neither side’s total liability for breach of this agreement will exceed the amount of fees the vendor received from the customer under this agreement during the twelve months before the first claim is made. This limit applies even if the side liable is advised that the other may suffer damages, and even if the customer paid no fees at all.
(d)	Uncapped Liabilities. Section 12(c) (Liability Cap) does not apply to:
(i)	the customer’s obligations to pay fees
(ii)	the vendor’s obligations to indemnify the customer
(iii)	liabilities the law requires to be unlimited
13.	Indemnities. These indemnities apply as long as the customer has paid all licensing fees as required by this agreement:
(a)	Scope of Indemnity. Throughout this agreement, to indemnify means to indemnify and hold the customer and its personnel harmless for all liability, expenses, damages, costs, and reasonable attorney fees, as well as to defend the indemnified party.

(e)	Indemnification Process. Both sides agree that to receive indemnification under this agreement, they must give notice of any covered claim quickly, allow the other side to control investigation, defense, and settlement, and cooperate with those efforts. Both sides agree that if they fail to give notice of any covered claim quickly, indemnification will not cover amounts that could have been defended against or mitigated if notice had been given quickly. Both sides agree that if they take control of the defense and settlement of any covered claim, they will not agree to any settlements that admit fault or impose obligations on the other side without their signed, written permission.
(f)	Repair, Replace, Refund. If the vendor or the customer receives written notice of a claim that the software infringes any intellectual property right or breaks any law, or vendor reasonably anticipates a claim of that kind:
(i)	The developer may provide the customer a new version of the software that no longer infringes or breaks the law. That new version will be covered by this agreement. The customer will not pay any additional fee for the new version.
(ii)	If the problem is infringement, the developer may get licenses for the customer so that the customer’s use of the software no longer infringes.
(iii)	If the problem is illegality, the developer may get the approvals, licenses, or other requirements needed to abide by the law.
(iv)	The developer may refund any fees the customer has prepaid under this agreement for time remaining in the term of this agreement, on a proportional basis, and end this agreement immediately by giving the customer notice. A refund does not apply if this is a perpetual agreement.

(i)	The customer agrees to make the required tax withholding payments for the vendor by deducting the right amounts from payments to the vendor and paying them to the proper tax authorities.
(ii)	The customer agrees to increase the amount of each payment made under this agreement, to offset withholding, so that the vendor receives the full amount owed.
(iii)	The customer agrees to give the vendor relevant official tax documentation and tax receipts showing that withholding was required and that proper withholding payment was made, as soon as possible after making any withholding payment.
15.	General Contract Terms.
(a)	Notices.
